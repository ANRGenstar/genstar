## Generation of Connected and Spatialized Synthetic Populations

- Core abstraction and algorithm could be find in Gospl (generation of synthetic population library)
- io is handled by the io package
- Spatialization algorithm could be find in Spll (Synthetic population localisation library)
- Network algorithm could be find in Spin (Synthetic population interaction network)
