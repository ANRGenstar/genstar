## Generation of Connected and Spatialized Synthetic Populations

- Core abstractions are define in Core module: IPopulation, IEntity, IAttribute and IValue, together with their direct implemented abtractions 
- Population generation algorithm could be find in Gospl module (generation of synthetic population library)
- Spatialization algorithm could be find in Spll module (Synthetic population localisation library)
- Network algorithm could be find in Spin module (Synthetic population interaction network)

## Maven setup

- just clone the repository
- import as Maven project in your favorite IDE

That's done, all dependencies are handle by maven

- If you want to add dependencies, please insert the corresponding Maven import into the pom.xml of current project you are working on (main pom if it concerns all project)
