/**
 * This class provides utilities to generate unique ids for entities.
 * 
 * An ID is unique at the scale of a population. It does not make sense to compare IDs from different 
 * populations. It means you can never find an entity in a population based on the ID of an entity 
 * you found in another population. If you find an entity bearing the same ID, it does not mean it is 
 * the same entity.
 * 
 * An entity ID does not change during the lifetime of an Entity.
 * 
 * The definition of the ID of an agent is part of the responsibility of its population {@link IPopulation},
 * which will call {@link EntityUniqueId.createNextId } to generate this ID.
 * 
 * The ID tries to be human readable, in the form "individual_2343" or "building_42". Yet if the 
 * type of the agent was defined or changed after its creation, the ID might not reflect the actual type.
 * 
 * This class is thread safe.
